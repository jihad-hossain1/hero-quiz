                            <span class="fw-semibold">map</span> method executes the same code on every element in an
                            array and returns a new array with the updated elements.

                            <span class="fw-semibold">filter</span> is a search function that returns all the elements

                            array is more than one result, that are return the first that has matched.

                            <span class="fw-semibold">localStorage</span> is a way to store data on the browser. It
                            allows the saving of key/value pairs in a web browser and it stores data with no expiration
                            date. we can setdata, clearing data, getdata from user in localStorage.
                        </p>

                            <span class="fw-semibold">SessionStorage</span> as stores data only for a session, meaning
                            that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <span class="fw-semibold">cookies</span> Stores data that has to be sent back to the server
                            with subsequent XHR requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration
                            duration can be set from either server-side or client-side . Cookies are primarily for
                            server-side reading. Cookies can be made secure by setting the httpOnly flag as true for
                            that cookie. This prevents client-side access to that cookie.

                        <p>
                            The event loop ensures that the JavaScript
                            code can continue to execute while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete. <br>
                            The event loop works by continuously checking the event queue and executing the tasks in the
                            queue. When a task is added to the queue, the event loop checks whether the call stack is
                            empty. If the call stack is empty, the task is immediately executed. If the call stack is
                            not empty, the task is placed in the queue and will be executed once the call stack becomes
                            empty. <br>
                            The event loop is a critical component of the JavaScript runtime, as it allows for the
                            efficient execution of asynchronous operations such as network requests and user input.
